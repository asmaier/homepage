"How is it possible that a group of average citizens doing Google searches in their suburban town homes can outpredict members of the United States intelligence community with access to classified information?" 

I think its a combination of "Wisdom of the crowd" and complete incompetence inside the intelligence community. So better shutdown the secret agencies and replace them with random average guys from the street.
