Interesting analysis of people on facebook. But as Stephen put it:

"Some of this is rather depressingly stereotypical."

So please guys: Stop talking about sports on facebook!
And please girls: Stop talking about friends and family on facebook!

Otherwise you belong to the "depressingly stereotypical" kind of type!
