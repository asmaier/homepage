It’s a safety problem if you cannot see where you’re going and if the windshield is not warm enough to melt snow and freezing rain while driving. Running the engine while actively clearing snow and ice off the vehicle and to warm the windshield and interior of the vehicle is necessary idling.<br /><br />http://www.toyota-4runner.org/general-discussions/25413-how-long-wait-after-starting-engine-cold-weather-5.html<br /><br /><br />http://www.wikihow.com/Start-a-Car-in-Freezing-Cold-Winter-Weather<br /><b><b>If your car is now started, you need to defrost your windows.</b></b> Put your defrost setting on medium (NOT HIGH).

(Ideally, go back inside a building and warm up while this is happening).<br /><br />http://www.climatechangesask.ca/html/individuals/On_Road/Cold_weather_qa/<br /><br />http://www.ehow.com/how_2063947_start-car-cold-weather.html<br /><br />http://www.slate.com/id/2192187/
