> ## [Creative Typographic Science Posters by Kapil Bhagat](http://www.boredpanda.com/typographic-scientist-name-posters-kapil-bhagat/)
>
>To celebrate the Science Day in India, Mumbai-based graphic designer Kapil Bhagat created a series of minimalist typographic posters featuring the names of famous scientists. Each design cues to an invention, a theory or an achievement that the scientist is known for. For example, Newton drops an O to illustrate gravity, a massive C in Copernicus reminds us that he figured the Earth was actually round.
