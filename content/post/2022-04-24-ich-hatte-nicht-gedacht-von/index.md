Ich hätte nicht gedacht von einem Pianisten (zumal einem russischen) so eine klare Stellungnahme zum Ukrainekrieg zu lesen. Er weiß alles und hat mit allem Recht. Wahrscheinlich ist er doch einfach ein Genie.

"however, what does surprise me a lot is that there are people in the West, people of firm democratic convictions, who share this view: that the West behaved too much like the winner of the Cold War. For me and my friends the exact opposite is obvious: the West did NOT behave like the winner of the Cold War — and that’s why we are having all these problems and tragedies now. After the Soviet Union ceased to exist, why on earth did Russia inherit its seat in the UN Security Council? I understand that after WWII it was probably difficult to avoid giving that seat to the Soviet Union — but why was it given to Russia after the Evil Empire collapsed? It should have been given to a deserving democratic country like, for example, Canada, Australia or Japan. And now we all see what problems are arising  from it. After the fall of communism the West should have done to Russia what it did to Germany after the fall of Nazism: communist leaders should have been tried by an international tribunal; the West should have forced Russia to outlaw the communist ideology, literature and symbols, to build dozens of memorials to the victims of communism, to repent constantly and to pay reparations to the numerous victims of the Kremlin bandits: Jews, Ukrainians, Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Georgians, Poles, Czechs and many others; the fifth columns in the Ukraine and the Baltic states should have been transferred to Russia in the same way, as the Germans of Sudetenland and Silesia were transferred to Germany after WWII. The West didn’t do any of that"

"When the foreign minister of Putin’s Russia dares to say to the British Foreign Minister: “Who are you to fucking lecture me?”, the latter should respond: “Watch your language, sir! I am the foreign minister of Great Britain, the eldest democracy of the world, a great democratic power — whereas you are an official of a criminal authoritarian regime, and therefore you and your cronies should be grateful that we are only lecturing you and not destroying you!"

"I must say that it became a grave disappointment for me when I realized a number of years ago that the Western principles, the Western ideals and the Western international politics are not the same thing; that most Western politicians for dozens of years had been betraying their own ideals and principles."

"Now I can only say to them: if you don’t do everything to help the brave Ukrainian people to win this war, to drive the aggressors and murderers out of their country, history will never forgive you. "

Ich empfehle jedem Evgeny Kissins Stellungnahme zu lesen. Und dann leitet sie weiter damit sie noch mehr Leute lesen. Ich zähle auf euch!
