From calculations of quantum tunneling through the horizon of a metric (black hole, Rindler..) Hawking/Unruh temperature can be calculated!

 * [http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:0710.0612 Ryan Kerner: Fermions Tunnelling from Black Holes] _

Using this method it is recently claimed that the so called [Black hole information paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox) can be solved:

* [Zhang et al. (2009): Hidden Messenger Revealed in Hawking Radiation: a Resolution to the Paradox of Black Hole Information Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0893)
The answer is, that the information that seems to be lost when matter falls into a black hole is in fact completely carried away by Hawking radiation. So in the whole process no information is lost.
