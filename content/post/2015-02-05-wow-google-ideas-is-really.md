Wow, Google Ideas is really evil: 

- Google Ideas seems to bond idealistic activist sensibilities with Google’s pursuit for continued global expansion - blurring the lines between business and political action. Schmidt and Cohen dub Google Ideas as a “think/do-tank” that aims to tackle political and diplomatic matters through the use of technology.
- "Google Ideas, a “think/do-tank” billed as a vehicle for spreading American-style liberal democracy"
- “GOOGLE is getting WH [White House] and State Dept. support and air cover. In reality, they are doing things the CIA cannot do. 

The topics on their web page (http://www.google.com/ideas/) are:

- What does digital conflict look like?
- How can technology help to disrupt illicit networks?
- How can Google Infrastructure support free expression?

That sound suspiciously like they are supporting aggressive undercover actions against foreign countries. States should not do this, but companies even less. What is Google thinking? Do they want to take over the world?
