> Computers are useless. They can only give you answers. (Pablo Picasso)

## Is Picasso correct?


In the scientific literature the question if a computer can be made to ask questions is hardly discussed. However literature containing the following terms implicitly discusses this topic:

* **[Unsupervised learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning)**
* **[Semi-supervised learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning)**
* **[Active learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning#Active_Learning)**
