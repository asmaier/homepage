"Germany has the highest share of inheritor-billionaires among developed economies, 65 percent. "

"Germany’s high share of family wealth is in part a consequence of a tax system that until this year allowed family-owned businesses -- including a large proportion of the medium-sized companies that are the backbone of its economy -- to pass on their financial assets while paying almost no estate tax."
