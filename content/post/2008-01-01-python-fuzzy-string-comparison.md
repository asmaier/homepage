## Fuzzy string comparison



    >>> import difflib
    >>> s=difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, "abcd","bcde")
    # Return a measure of the sequencesâ€™ similarity as a float in the range [0, 1].
    # This is 1.0 if the sequences are identical, and 0.0 if they have nothing in common.
    >>> print s.ratio()
    0.75
