They never provide a theory to fully justify how the patterns identified would be special marking a bubble, and how these same patterns could be captured within a bottom-up fashion. Furthermore, if they identity multifractal scaling in the markets how do they reconcile that with this special scale specific phenomenon, doesn’t that break the multifractality? And if it breaks, why does it break, what are the economic reasons, for this?<br /><br />The following two lectures contain explanations by Sornette of this work, in the first lecture he extensively criticizes Fed’s policy and proposes what he sees as solutions:<br /><br /><a href="http://videolectures.net/ccss09_sornette_fbreb/" target="_blank">http://videolectures.net/ccss09_sornette_fbreb/</a><br /><br /><a href="http://videolectures.net/risc08_sornette_fcrm/" target="_blank">http://videolectures.net/risc08_sornette_fcrm/</a>
