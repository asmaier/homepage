abstract: In the context of explosion models for Type Ia Supernovae, we present one-
  and two-dimensional simulations of fully resolved detonation fronts in degenerate
  C+O White Dwarf matter including clumps of previously burned material. The ability
  of detonations to survive the passage through sheets of nuclear ashes is tested
  as a function of the width and composition of the ash region. We show that detonation
  fronts are quenched by microscopically thin obstacles with little sensitivity to
  the exact ash composition. Front-tracking models for detonations in macroscopic
  explosion simulations need to include this effect in order to predict the amount
  of unburned material in delayed detonation scenarios.
