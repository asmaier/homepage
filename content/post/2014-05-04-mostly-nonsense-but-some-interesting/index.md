Mostly nonsense, but some interesting correlations:

- The division line into sunny/cloudy europe (4) is basically the same as the division line into tomato/potato europe (5) . So we learn the interesting fact: Tomatos need sunny weather!
- The division lines between rich/poor(11) and lazy/hard-working(12) are basically orthogonal. This means that according to these graphs there is a list of countries, which are generally seen as lazy, but also rich at the same time: Spain, South of France, North of Italy, Switzerland and Austria. Also one country is really doing it wrong and seems hard-working, but also poor: Russia. So we learn the another interesting fact: hard work does not necessarily make you rich, but being lazy also does not make you poor.
