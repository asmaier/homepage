summary: Correl-O-Mat is a python script for analyzing correlations from the data
  of the [wahl-o-mat](http://www.bpb.de/politik/wahlen/wahl-o-mat/). It generates
  a correlation matrix counting all questions where the parties agree with each other.
  This shows, which parties share opinions and therefor are similar to each other
  (with sometimes [surprising results](http://asmaier.blogspot.de/2014/05/europawahl-2014-interessante.html)!).
