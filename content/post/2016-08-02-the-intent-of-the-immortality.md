"The intent of the Immortality Drive is to preserve human DNA in a time capsule, in case some global cataclysm should occur on Earth."

"The Immortality Drive contains fully digitized DNA sequences of ... physicist Stephen Hawking, comedian Stephen Colbert, Playboy model Jo Garcia, game designer Richard Garriott, fantasy authors Tracy Hickman and Laura Hickman, pro wrestler Matt Morgan, and athlete Lance Armstrong."﻿
