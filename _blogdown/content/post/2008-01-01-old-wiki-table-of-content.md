Here I collect notes about a lot of things and topics I think are interesting.

## Physics

* Moving black holes: 
Since a black hole is a state of highest entropy, is a black hole moving at the speed of light the highest entropy transfer rate that can exist in nature? As a starting point here are some papers showing the metric of an accelerating body in GR:
 * [W. Kinnersley (1961): Uniformly Accelerating Charged Mass in General Relativity](http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v2/i8/p1359_1)
 * [W. Kinnersley (1963): Field of an Arbitrarily Accelerating Point Mass](http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v186/i5/p1335_1)
* General relativistic boltzmann equation:
 * [Debbasch,van Leeuwen: the General Relativistic Boltzmann Equation](http://www-math.unice.fr/~brenier/fichiers.ps.pageperso/ProcStoch_Nice20070115_WillemVanLeeuwen.pdf) 
 * [Debbasch, van Leeuwen: General relativistic Boltzmann equation, II: Manifestly covariant treatment](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009PhyA..388.1818D)
 * [Debbasch, van Leeuwen: General relativistic Boltzmann equation, I: Covariant treatment](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009PhyA..388.1079D)
 * [Debbasch: A diffusion process in curved spaceâ€“time](http://link.aip.org/link/?JMAPAQ/45/2744/1) 
* Is matter condensed space-time??
* [P.Kovtun, D.T.Son, A.O.Starinets: Viscosity in Strongly Interacting Quantum Field Theories from Black Hole Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0405231)
* Is teleporting a photon the same as teleporting the universe, but keeping one photon at it's place? (Mach's Principle?!, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation])
## Computer Science

* [Python]({{<ref "2008-01-01-python-fuzzy-string-comparison.md" >}})
* [Can a computer ask questions?]({{<ref "2008-01-01-can-a-computer-ask-questions.md" >}})
* [Netflix Prize]({{<ref "2008-01-01-netflix-prize.md" >}})
* [Books about neural networks/artificial intelligence/data mining]({{<ref "2008-01-01-ai-books.md" >}})
* [How "Google Sets" Works](http://www.seobythesea.com/?p=1025)
* [Fast similarity search in large dictionaries](http://fastss.csg.uzh.ch/) (ETH Zuerich)
* A coordinate system for the internet based on the real world (each webpage gets a geographical coordinate (based on the topic or the location of the author), and if that's not available expand the geographical coordinates to geographical ones in a virtual world, e.g. planet maier ;-) ). Can one buy a certain coordinate location in the real world (where nothing can be found e.g. somewhere between mars and the asteroid belt) and use it as virtual location for a web site (and in that sense hack augmented reality)? For example one points with the iPhone at a certain location at the sky, which would then reveal that in this direction some billion kilometers away the web page of some guy is located.

## Society


* [Limits to Growth]({{<ref "2008-01-01-limits-to-growth.md" >}})

## Programming and Markup Languages

* [How to insert a linebreak in a bulleted list using wikidot.com syntax](http://community.wikidot.com/forum/t-1047/include-newline-in-wiki-syntax#post-515380)

## Internet


* [Top-level domains]({{<ref "2008-01-01-top-level-domains.md" >}})

## Search


* [http://www.eyeplorer.com] : Finding relations between wikipedia articles
* [http://www.powerset.com/] : a search and discovery experience for Wikipedia, launched in May 2008, acquired by Microsoft.
* [http://www.bing.com/] : Microsofts idea of web search
* [http://ep.espacenet.com/?locale=en_EP] : Search engine of European Patent Office (EPO) for patents worldwide
* [http://www.google.com/patents] : Googles search engine for patents in the USA
* [http://patft.uspto.gov/] : USA patents search engine of the USPTO (U.S Patent and Trademark Office)
