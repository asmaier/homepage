"Wer nichts zu verbergen hat, hat auch nichts zu befürchten." 
Außer er wird von einem fehlerhaften Algorithmus zum Terroristen abgestempelt und dann per Drone liquidiert. Schöne neue Welt!

"According to the documents, SKYNET engages in mass surveillance of Pakistan's mobile phone network, and then uses a machine learning algorithm on the cellular network metadata of 55 million people to try and rate each person's likelihood of being a terrorist.
...
A flaw in how the NSA trains SKYNET's machine learning algorithm to analyse cellular metadata, Ball told Ars, makes the results scientifically unsound.
...
In the years that have followed, thousands of innocent people in Pakistan may have been mislabelled as terrorists by that "scientifically unsound" algorithm, possibly resulting in their untimely demise."
