abstract: In this paper we argue that the predominant flat rate billing in conjunction with the practice of overbooking and its associated mismatch between actual costs and billed posts results in a substantial misalignment between the interests of providers and customers that stands in the way of trustworthy and sustainable cloud computing. On these grounds, we propose a hybrid IaaS pricing model that aims to avoid these problems in a non-technical fashion by shifting to consumption based billing on top of credible minimum performance.
