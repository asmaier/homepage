The hybrid system gives better recognition result due to better discrimination capability of the NN [3]. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a promising recognition method, which is an alternative to NN. In speech recognition (SR), SVM has been successfully used in the context of a hybrid SVM/HMM system. It gives a better recognition result compared to the system based on hybrid NN/HMM[4]. In OHR, SVM have been used in character recognition with quite promising results [8].

A handwritten character is represented as a sequence of strokes whose features are extracted and classified. Sup- port vector machines have been used for constructing the stroke recognition engine. The results have been presented after testing the system on Devanagari and Telugu scripts.</div><div><a href="http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/10/44/02/PDF/cr1076204763062.pdf">Online Handwritten Character Recognition of Devanagari and Telugu ...</a></div><div><br /></div><div>We apply functional approximation techniques to ob- tain features from online data and use these features to train support vector machines (SVMs) for online mathe- matical symbol classification. We show experimental re- sults and comparisons with another SVM-based system trained using features used in the literature. The experi- mental results show that the SVM trained using features from functional approximation produces results compa- rable to the other SVM based recognition system. This makes the functional approximation technique interesting and competitive since the features have certain computa- tional advantages.</div><div><a href="http://www.activemath.org/workshops/MathUI/08/proceedings/KeshariWatt-SVM-Recog-FuncApprox-MathUI08.pdf">Online Mathematical Symbol Recognition using SVMs with Features ...</a></div><div><br /></div><div>The SVC with RBF kernel (SVC-rbf) gives the highest accuracy in most cases but is extremely expensive in storage and computation. Among the non-SV classi􏰀ers, the polynomial classi􏰀er and DLQDF give the highest accuracies.
