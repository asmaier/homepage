Der Erfinder von Keras beschreibt hier die wichtigsten Probleme
und mögliche Lösungen für die Anwendung von AI.
Ein absoluter Must-Read-Artikel:

"The issue is not AI itself. *The issue is control.*
....
Here’s an idea — any algorithmic newsfeed with significant adoption should:

- Transparently convey what objectives the feed algorithm is currently
optimizing for, and how these objectives are affecting your
information diet.
- Give you intuitive tools to set these goals yourself. For instance,
it should be possible for you to configure your newsfeed to maximize
learning and personal growth — in specific directions.
- Feature an always-visible measure of how much time you are spending
on the feed.
- Feature tools to stay control of how much time you’re spending on
the feed — such as a daily time target, past which the algorithm will
seek to get you off the feed.
...
What if newsfeed algorithms didn’t operate like casino operators or
propagandists? What if instead, they were closer to a mentor or a good
librarian,
...
In the far future, such products will likely take the form of AI assistants.
...
Build search engines and digital assistants, not social newsfeeds.
Make your recommendation engines transparent, configurable, and
constructive, rather than slot-like machines that maximize
“engagement” and wasted hours of human time."
