The process of knowledge generation involves finding links or connections between already existing pieces of knowledge. There are some applications out there, that can help with that:

* [PaperCube](http://papercube.peterbergstrom.com)
* [PathWay](http://pathway.screenager.be/), see also [CNET: New Mac Review: Keep Wikipedia research focused with Pathway](http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-9823587-12.html)

Also helpful would be a Google Scholar API, but it does not exist yet:

* [google-ajax-apis: Issue 109: Please add Google Scholar to the API, including # of citations and BibTex reference.](http://code.google.com/p/google-ajax-apis/issues/detail?id=109)
* [Google Scholar API and PaperCube](http://linklens.blogspot.com/2009/04/google-scholar-api-and-papercube.html)

But here is a python receipe, which allows to retrieve results from Google Scholar as dictionary
