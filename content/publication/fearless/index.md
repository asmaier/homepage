abstract: FEARLESS (Fluid mEchanics with Adaptively Refined Large Eddy SimulationS)
  is a new numerical scheme arising from the combined use of subgrid scale (SGS) model
  for turbulence at the unresolved length scales and adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
  for resolving the large scales. This tool is especially suitable for the study of
  turbulent flows in strongly clumped media. In this contribution, the main features
  of FEARLESS are briefly outlined. We then summarize the main results of FEARLESS
  cosmological simulations of galaxy cluster evolution. In clusters, the production
  of turbulence is closely correlated with merger events; for minor mergers, we find
  that turbulent dissipation affects the cluster energy budget only locally. The level
  of entropy in the cluster core is enhanced in FEARLESS simulations, in accord with
  a better modeling of the unresolved flow, and with its feedback on the resolved
  mixing in the ICM.
