"However in 2018 the fuel made up just 5% of Britain’s electricity generation, a big decline from about 40% in 2012"

"Coal has mainly been replaced by natural gas, which produces less than half the carbon dioxide emissions. Renewable sources with no direct carbon emissions, such as solar and wind power, accounted for 28% of electricity generation in 2018"

"The government last year revealed plans to shut down all coal-fired power stations by 2025, but it has come under pressure to accelerate the transition "

Den Engländern ist 2025 für den Kohleausstieg nicht schnell genug! Und wir reden in Deutschland über 2038!
