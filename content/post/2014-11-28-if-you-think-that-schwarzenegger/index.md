If you think that Schwarzenegger could never survive the explosion of the nuclear bomb at the end of the movie Predator, think again:  

"Tsutomu Yamaguchi  was a survivor of both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings during World War II."

He lived happily ever after until the age of 93. 
Why is there no movie about this bad ass guy?
