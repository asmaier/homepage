> ## [Six more years of Putin Animator Egor Zhgun retells Russia's latest presidency in cartoons — Meduza](https://meduza.io/en/shapito/2018/03/20/six-more-years-of-putin)
>
>On March 2, 2012, two days before Russia’s presidential election, animator Egor Zhgun published a two-minute cartoon retelling 12 years of Russia under Vladimir Putin, depicting Putin as Mr. Burns and other Russian public figures as different characters from The Simpsons. The video went on to attract more than 6.3 million views. On March 19, a day after Putin claimed his fourth presidential term, Zhgun released another cartoon depicting the last six years in Russia. The video is full of so many political and cultural references that Meduza decided to break it down, so you can watch it and understand everything.
