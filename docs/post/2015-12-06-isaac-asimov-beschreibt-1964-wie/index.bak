Isaac Asimov beschreibt 1964 wie die Welt im Jahre 2014 aussieht. Er hat erstaunlich viele Treffer. Nur der letzte Absatz liegt leider weit daneben:

"Even so, mankind will suffer badly from the disease of boredom, a disease spreading more widely each year and growing in intensity...Indeed, the most somber speculation I can make about A.D. 2014 is that in a society of enforced leisure, the most glorious single word in the vocabulary will have become work!"

                What is to come, through the fair's eyes at least, is wonderful. The direction in which man is traveling is viewed with buoyant hope, nowhere more so than at the General Electric pavilion. There the audience whirls through four scenes, each populated
                by cheerful, lifelike dummies that move and talk with a facility that, inside of a minute and a half, convinces you they are alive.
