<div>Thus, we find a natural thermodynamical definition of the volume in terms of the residue of ζM(s) at this pole: V = (4π)d/2Γ(d/2)Ld Res(d/2) :</div><div><br /></div><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1148">[1010.1148] Thermodynamics of photons on fractals</a><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.1148"></a><div>http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/01/fractals-plus-quantum-mechanics-equals-chaos.ars?comments=1&amp;start=40#comments-bar</div><div><br /></div><div>Is a curved space-time equivalent to a non-differential (fractal) space-time? </div><div>are physical quantities like velocity scale dependent even in vacuum, because of the fractal</div><div>nature of space-time?
