This article shows the amazing possibility how our feelings are can be controlled by bacteria and parasites. Combine this with the knowledge of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_bacteriotherapy
and you will see where the journey will go. Maybe in the future people will try to get bacteria/parasites from famous/successful people and try to implant them in themselves? 
For further reference see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasites_Lost.
