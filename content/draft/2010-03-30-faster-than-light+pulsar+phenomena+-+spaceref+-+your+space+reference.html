title: Faster-than-Light Pulsar Phenomena | SpaceRef - Your Space Reference
---

<a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=29949">Faster-than-Light Pulsar Phenomena | SpaceRef - Your Space Reference</a>: "arXiv:0912.0350"<br /><br /><span style="font-family:geneva,arial,verdana;font-size:-1;">However, in papers presented this week to the American Astronomical Society, Andrea Schmidt and John Singleton of Los Alamos National Laboratory provide detailed analyses of several pieces of observational data that suggest that pulsars emit the electromagnetic equivalent of the well-known "sonic boom" from accelerating supersonic aircraft. Just as the "boom" can be very loud a long way from the aircraft, the analogous signals from the pulsar remain intense over very long distances.<br /><br />Schmidt and Singleton's presentations provide strong support for a pulsar emission mechanism (the superluminal model) due to circulating polarization currents that travel faster than the speed of light. These superluminal polarization currents are disturbances in the pulsar's plasma atmosphere in which oppositely-charged particles are displaced by small amounts in opposite directions; they are induced by the neutron star's rotating magnetic field. Despite the large speed of the polarization current itself, the small displacements of the charged particles that make it up means that their velocities remain slower than light, so that Einstein's theory of Special Relativity is not violated. No laws of physics are broken in this model!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family:geneva,arial,verdana;font-size:-1;">Back in the 1980s, Nobel laureate Vitaly Ginzburg and colleagues showed that such faster-than-light polarization currents will act as sources of electromagnetic radiation. Since then, the theory has been developed by Houshang Ardavan of Cambridge University, UK, and several ground-based demonstrations of the principle have been carried out in the United Kingdom, Russia and the USA. Thus far, polarization currents traveling at up to six times the speed of light (i.e. 1.8 million km per second) have been demonstrated to emit tightly-focused bursts of radiation by the ground-based experiments. Note that, though the source of radiation exceeds the speed of light, the emitted radiation travels at the normal light speed once it leaves the source.</span><br /><br />http://www.santafenewmexican.com/HealthandScience/LANL_scientist_makes_radio_waves_travel_faster_than_light<br /><br />http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/p/colloquium/abstracts_03_04/abstract_singleton.shtml
