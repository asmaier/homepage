An amazing 360 degrees view of the night sky! It is so cool to get a feeling of where we are in the milky-way. One can either look towards the center of the milky-way or turn around and look to the out-skirts. Or have a look into the emptiness of the sky upwards and downwards. 
Exam: Try to find the andromeda galaxy!

The data is a teaser for the amazing http://skysurvey.org/ app, see also
